SSres = SUM(y - ypred)^2
SStot = SUM(y - yavg)^2
R^2 = 1 - SSres/SStot

R2 = 1   Perfect fit
R2 = 0.9 Very good
R2 < 0.7 Not great
R2 < 0.4 Terrible

Problem:
Now you decide to add a new feature,
SStot doesnt change
SSres will decrease or stay the same (SSres -> min)

Now, if there is a case where the feature will increase but doesnt decrease the SSres value, so the coefficient of the feature -> 0. Thus as we keep adding features it may result in many coeff of features being Zero. thus degrading the R2 value.

Solution: 
Adjusted R^2 = 1 - (1-R^2)*(n-1)/(n-k-1)
k = no. of indepedent variables 
n = sample size
