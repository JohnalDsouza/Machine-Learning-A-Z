P-Value
We want to study the relationship between the height of students and their grades in a class of 100 students. We collect the data and perform a hypothesis test to determine whether there is a statistically significant relationship between height and grades.

Our null hypothesis is that there is no significant relationship between height and grades, and our alternative hypothesis is that there is a significant relationship between height and grades.

After performing the hypothesis test, we calculate a p-value of 0.03. This means that there is a 3% chance that the observed relationship between height and grades occurred by chance, and a 97% chance that it is a result of the variables we are studying.

Since our significance level is 0.05, which is the maximum probability of making a Type I error (rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true), we can conclude that the p-value of 0.03 is less than the significance level, and therefore we can reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. This suggests that there is indeed a statistically significant relationship between height and grades in our dataset.

In this way, p-value helps us to make informed decisions based on the statistical significance of our results, and helps to avoid drawing false conclusions from our data.

In short, P-value < Significance Level, ie Regect the Hypothesis as it was not on chance.

*******************************************************************

Backward Elimination
STEP 1: Select a significance level to stay in the model (e.g. SL = 0.05)
STEP 2: Fit the full model with all possible predictors
STEP 3: Consider the predictor with the highest P-value. If P > SL, go to STEP 4, otherwise go to FIN
STEP 4: Remove the predictor
STEP 5: Fit model without this variable*
FIN: Your Model is Ready
* go to step 3

*******************************************************************

Forward Selection
STEP 1: Select a significance level to enter the model (e.g. SL = 0.05)
STEP 2: Fit all simple regression models y ~ xn Select the one with the lowest P-value
STEP 3: Keep this variable and fit all possible models with one extra predictor added to the one(s) you
already have
STEP 4: Consider the predictor with the lowest P-value. If P < SL, go to STEP 3, otherwise go to FIN
FIN: Keep the previous model

*******************************************************************

Backward Elimination(Fastest)
STEP 1: Select a significance level to enter and to stay in the model
e.g.: SLENTER = 0.05, SLSTAY = 0.05
STEP 2: Perform the next step of Forward Selection (new variables must have: P < SLENTER to enter)
STEP 3: Perform ALL steps of Backward Elimination (old variables must have P < SLSTAY to stay), go to step 2
STEP 4: No new variables can enter and no old variables can exit
FIN: Your Model Is Ready

*******************************************************************

All Possible Models
STEP 1: Select a criterion of goodness of fit (e.g. Akaike criterion)
STEP 2: Construct All Possible Regression Models: 2N-1 total combinations
STEP 3: Select the one with the best criterion
FIN: Your Model Is Ready
